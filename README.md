# BASH SCRIPTS FOR LINUX  
___
### These are simple BASH scripts that I have created to use on my local linux machine. Feel free to copy and or edit them to your liking.  

<br>

### To Run the scripts from the command line interace/shell: 
> ./scriptName

<br>

### Some scripts can also have arguments passed in like so:
> ./scriptName argument

<br>

### <span>checkhidden.sh</span>

### <span>itemcounter.sh</span>
